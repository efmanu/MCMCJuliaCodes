# Define the target distribution

    # For example, if you want to sample from a normal distribution with mean mu and variance sigma^2,
    # you can use the following code:
    # return exp(-0.5 * ((x - mu) / sigma)^2)
end

# Define the proposal distribution
function proposal_distribution(x)
    # Return a new sample generated from the proposal distribution, centered at point x
    # Modify this function according to your specific proposal distribution
    # For example, if you want to use a normal distribution as the proposal distribution,
    # you can use the following code:
    # return x + randn()
end
